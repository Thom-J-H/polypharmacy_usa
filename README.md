This project explores explores the usage of prescription drugs in the USA as reported by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/contents2019.htm#Table-039) in “Table 39.

<em>Table 39</em>, which stops at the <strong>Year Range</strong> 2015-2018, is the most recent data publicly available. The source data is downloadable from the CDC as an [Excel file](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/contents2019.htm#Table-039) and a [PDF](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2019/039-508.pdf).


The data shows over time a disturbing prevalence towards [polypharmacy](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Polypharmacy): the “use of multiple medications by a patient.” This prevalence is consistent across all four <strong>Age Groups</strong> in the data set: Under 18, 18-44, 45-64, and 65 & older.

The drastic increase in polypharmacy has both public health and environmental implications. Please see the following reports by the [NIH](https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/dangers-polypharmacy-and-case-deprescribing-older-adults), the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://toxics.usgs.gov/highlights/antidepressants_fish.html), and [Circle of Blue](https://www.circleofblue.org/2011/world/unprescribed-u-s-pharmaceutical-industry-fights-to-avoid-paying-for-drug-disposal-programs/), to start.

This project has an associated dashboard at RPubs: [Polypharmacy USA](https://rpubs.com/Thom_JH/polypharmacy_usa).

The report was completed for the Substack [American Exile](https://americanexile.substack.com/).
